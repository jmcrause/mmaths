# mmaths

This is a "Mental Maths" program that was created for a primary school to test learner's basic mathematics abilities.

There is a Menu page which can redirect the learner to the specific test, sorted by day of the week for 3 weeks. This page also shows all marks of comleted tests.

When the learner is done, he/she will press the "Finnished" button. The test is then autoatically marked.
The test is timed and if the time runs out, the test is marked and the learner no longer has the option to change any answers.
The "Main Menu" button will take the learner back to the main menu sheet. If this button is pressed before the test is marked, the test will be marked before going to the Main Menu
